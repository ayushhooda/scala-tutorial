Four ways to handle exceptions in Scala:
1. Option
Option is basically an abstract class which is being extended by Some class and None case object.

2. Either
Either is also an abstract class which is being extended by Left and Right class.

3. Try block
Try is an abstract class which is extended by Success and Failure class

4. try and catch
